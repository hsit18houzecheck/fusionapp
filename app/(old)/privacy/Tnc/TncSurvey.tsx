          <span className="font-bold">a. Before the Inspection</span>
          <br />
          This period forms an important part of the relationship between the
          <strong> Surveyor</strong> and the<strong> Client</strong>. The
          commissioned
          <strong> Surveyor</strong> will use reasonable endeavors to contact
          the
          <strong> Client</strong> to understand particular concerns about the
          property and explain (where necessary) the extent and/or limitations
          of the inspection and report.

          <br />
          <span className="font-bold">b. After the inspection</span>
          <br />
          The commissioned<strong> Surveyor</strong> will use reasonable
          endeavors to contact the
          <strong> Client</strong> after the inspection to discuss the major
          points and issues found. The content of this conversation will not in
          any way override the content of the report. The report will take
          precedence in all cases.

          <strong>Limitations</strong>
          <br />
          Where advice or opinions are required outside the reasonable
          professional skill and expertise of the<strong> Surveyor</strong>, he
          or she will advise you on the need for further specialist involvement
          where we consider this to be necessary for the completion of your
          instruction(s).

        <li>
          <strong>Insurance Rebuilding Cost Assessment</strong>
          <br />
          The<strong> Surveyor</strong> will provide an insurance rebuilding
          cost assessment only if this is agreed at the time of taking
          instructions. The Reinstatement Cost figure (If requested in the
          Client instruction) for the permanent buildings is provided for
          insurance purposes and is not directly related to the market value of
          the property. The reinstatement cost will be calculated by reference
          to the indices and guidance published by the Building Costs
          Information Service (BCIS). The figure stated will only include Value
          Added Tax on professional fees (not on building costs) and will not
          take into account other potential or consequential losses such as
          costs of demolition, site clearance, provision of services,
          alternative accommodation, personal items or any other contents or
          contingent costs.

          <strong>Force Majeure</strong>
          <br />
          Whilst every reasonable effort will be made to carry out the
          inspection at the date/time agreed, we cannot be held liable for any
          losses caused by matters outside our control, such as, but not
          exclusively:<strong> Surveyor</strong> illness; traffic/vehicle

              may only do so with specific written consent of

              <strong>External Cladding Panels and Fire Safety –</strong>{" "}
              Composite external panels which incorporate insulating material
              between inner and outer external wall faces such as aluminium
              composite material (ACM) panels have been extensively used in
              recent years as external cladding. Some panel cladding systems
              incorporate combustible insulation materials. The type of
              insulation and any fire checking of the panel system cannot be
              identified from a visual inspection. Where the existence of such
              panels has been reported, the type of insulation and installation
              <strong> is outside the scope of The Survey Report</strong>. Other
              elements of the
              <strong> Property</strong> and building will also have a bearing
              on overall fire safety, including, fire doors, fire stops in wall
              cavities, escape routes, alarms and fire suppression systems. Such
              matters
              <strong> are outside the scope of The Survey Report</strong>. For
              buildings of more than two storeys it is essential that the Fire
              Safety Certificate, (EWS1), is supplied. For buildings of two
              storey height or less the Surveyor will make the assumption that
              the cladding system is satisfactory. It is the responsibility of
              <strong> The Client</strong> to have any materials tested and if
              found to be not in compliance,
              <strong> The Client</strong> should make all necessary enquiries
              prior to any legal or financial commitment.

              Asbestos and other hazardous materials: The construction of
              buildings, fixtures, fittings and plant or equipment may contain
              hazardous materials. Such materials are impossible to detect
              without specific tests and are beyond the scope of the
              <strong> Survey Report</strong>. No guarantee is given that such
              materials are not incorporated in any part of the property or
              fixtures. The service does not include an asbestos inspection and
              it falls outside The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012.

          <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
          <br />
          RICS recommends the use of liability caps to members to manage the
          risk in valuation and survey work. Our aggregate liability arising out
          of or in connection with this service, whether arising from
          negligence, breach of contract or any cause whatsoever, shall in no
          event exceed 15% of the Market Value of
          <strong> The Subject Property</strong>
          at the date of inspection, or the purchase price in relation to this
          report (whichever is the lesser). We will not be responsible for the
          first £2,000.00 of any claim. This clause shall not exclude liability
          for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.

          <strong>The Survey Report</strong> is provided for
          <strong> The Clients</strong> use only, and we cannot accept
          responsibility if it is used or relied upon by anyone else, any other
          or third parties, unless this is expressly agreed by

              be provided after diligent consideration and research, but
              property values are subject to fluctuation and the valuation
              process is inexact and thus the
              <strong> Surveyor’s</strong> opinion is subject to a degree of
              tolerance depending on the property and the availability of
              comparable evidence. Valuations are provided to assist the Client

              <strong> Survey Report</strong> (including a valuation produced

              be entitled to pursue any action for alleged negligence, breach of

        <span className="font-bold">a)</span> The
        <span className="font-bold"> Surveyor</span> will make reasonable
        assumptions which will be specified in the
        <strong> Survey Report</strong>. However, if these assumptions are found
        to be incorrect please advise us immediately as the valuation may
        require to be amended to take account of any newly disclosed, amended or
        discovered facts.

          c)External Cladding Panels and Fire Safety{" "}
        </span>
        – Composite external panels which incorporate insulating material
        between inner and outer external wall faces such as aluminium composite
        material (ACM) panels have been extensively used in recent years as
        external cladding. Some panel cladding systems incorporate combustible
        insulation materials. The type of insulation and any fire checking of
        the panel system cannot be identified from a visual inspection. Where
        the existence of such panels has been reported, the type of insulation
        and installation
        <strong>
          {" "}
          is outside the scope of The Survey Report and the Valuation
        </strong>
        . Other elements of the<strong> Property</strong> and building will also
        have a bearing on overall fire safety, including, fire doors, fire stops
        in wall cavities, escape routes, alarms and fire suppression systems.
        Such matters
        <strong> are outside the scope of the Valuation</strong>. For buildings
        of more than two storeys it is essential that the Fire Safety
        Certificate, (EWS1), is supplied. Where the nature of the cladding is
        considered to be suspect, the
        <strong> Surveyor</strong> will report a Zero Value until the form EWS1
        in Compliance is supplied. For buildings of two storey height or less
        the Surveyor will make the assumption that the cladding system is
        satisfactory. It is the responsibility of
        <strong> The Client</strong> to have any materials tested and if found
        to be not in compliance, the<strong> Valuation</strong> may then require
        to be adjusted.
        <strong> The Client</strong> should make all necessary enquiries prior
        to any legal or financial commitment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold">d)</span> Asbestos and other hazardous
        materials: The construction of buildings, fixtures, fittings and plant
        or equipment may contain hazardous materials. Such materials are
        impossible to detect without specific tests and are beyond the scope of
        the<strong> Survey Report</strong>. No guarantee is given that such
        materials are not incorporated in any part of the property or fixtures.
        The service does not include an asbestos inspection and it falls outside
        The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold">e)</span> The Inspection will take into
        account gardens, grounds and permanent outbuildings, but will not
        include constructions or equipment with a specific or leisure purpose,
        including sauna, swimming pools or tennis courts and associated services
        and changing rooms. The Inspection will include the immediate gardens
        that belong to the property, but the Inspection specifically excludes
        any additional land such as pasture or amenity land.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold">f)</span> Measurement – the
        <strong> Surveyor </strong>may measure the property during the
        inspection or take measurements or areas from plans provided by the
        Client or obtain such details from specialised database information
        available to the<strong> Surveyor</strong> or from publicly available
        information at the sole discretion of the
        <strong> Surveyor</strong>. Outbuildings will not be measured on site
        unless they are considered by the
        <strong> Surveyor</strong> to contribute significantly to the reported
        capital value or reinstatement cost (if reported).

        <span className="font-bold">
          g) The Following Additional Assumptions
        </span>{" "}
        will be made by the<strong> Surveyor</strong> in respect of the
        <strong> Property</strong>:
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          the ground is not affected by the existence of noxious or toxic
          substances or gases and has not been used for landfill or mineral
          extraction or other forms of contamination, and does not contain
          gypsum deposits;
        </li>
        <li>
          no high alumina cement concrete or calcium chloride additive or other
          potentially deleterious material including ‘Mundic material’ was used
          in the construction of the property or has since been incorporated;
        </li>
        <li>
          the<strong> Property</strong> is not susceptible to radon gas
          pollution, invasive or protected species, flood risk, high voltage
          equipment, cables or coastal erosion, unless specified in the report;
        </li>
        <li>
          the<strong> Property</strong> is not subject to any unusual or
          especially onerous restrictions, encumbrances or outgoings, easements
          or way leaves or rights of way over the property and that good title
          can be shown;
        </li>
        <li>
          the<strong> Property</strong> and its value are unaffected by any
          matters which would be revealed by local or environmental searches,
          and replies to the usual enquiries, or by any statutory notice, and
          that neither the property, nor its condition, nor its use, nor its
          intended use, is or will be unlawful;
        </li>
        <li>
          the inspection of those parts which have not been included in the
          Inspection in accordance with these Terms and Conditions would neither
          reveal material defects nor cause the
          <strong> Surveyor</strong> to alter the valuation materially;
        </li>
        <li>
          it is assumed that unless otherwise stated, roads, sewers and services
          outside the curtilage of the<strong> Property</strong> are the
          responsibility of the Local Authority or other statutory body. It is
          further assumed, unless otherwise stated, that all services including
          drainage are connected and access and roads are unfettered, and in the
          case of the public highway, maintained at the expense of the Local and
          Highways Authorities;
        </li>
        <li>
          the<strong> Valuation</strong> is based on the assumption that the
          Property is being valued with vacant possession and, unless otherwise
          stated, for owner occupation; if the property is tenanted the
          <strong> Client</strong> is under a duty to inform the
          <strong> Surveyor</strong>;
        </li>
        <li>
          that further investigation into Planning Permission, Building
          Regulations, Permitted Development Rights, extensions and alterations,
          hazardous materials, onerous restrictions or the like will not reveal
          anything sufficiently adverse as to materially affect the
          <strong> Valuation</strong>;
        </li>
        <li>
          in the case of Leasehold Tenure the<strong> Surveyor</strong> will
          assume that there remains a minimum of 85 years on the lease, and the
          Ground Rent and any Service Charges are reasonable unless otherwise
          detailed in the report;
        </li>

          there are no archaeological remains, Scheduled Ancient Monument or

        </li>
        <li>
          any other assumptions will be clearly stated in the report; however,
          the
          <strong> Surveyor</strong> shall be under no duty to verify these
          assumptions and the
          <strong> Client</strong> should ensure the assumptions are correct. If
          any of these assumptions are incorrect then these should be discussed
          with the Valuer before any financial or legal commitment is made as
          the Valuer&apos;s opinion of value may change;

        <li>
          if the<strong> Surveyor</strong> has not been provided, or cannot
          obtain, an up-to-date EPC rating for this property, for the purposes
          of the Energy Act 2011, its valuation will be based on the assumption
          that the subject property will meet the minimum requirements laid down
          by legislation and that there will be no adverse impact on value,
          rental ability and marketability;

          in the case of a newly constructed property, it has been built under a
          recognised builder’s warranty or insurance scheme, or has been
          supervised by a professional consultant capable of fully completing
          the UK Finance Professional Consultant Certificate;

        <span className="font-bold">h) Leasehold Properties</span> will be made
        by the Surveyor in respect of the Property:
        <br />
        <br />
        Where<strong> The Subject Property</strong> is leasehold, data including
        unexpired lease term, ground rent and any further relevant information
        should be considered and reflected in the
        <strong> Valuation</strong> based upon data that can be sourced on the
        day of inspection or beforehand from either the vendor or the selling
        agent as applicable following reasonable investigation. However, the
        <strong> Surveyor </strong>
        clearly cannot give any absolute assurance that, if verbally provided,
        such data is reliable – verification will be a matter for your legal
        representatives as appropriate.
        <br />
        <br /> Where<strong> The Subject Property</strong> is leasehold, and it
        is not possible to inspect the lease or details have not been provided,
        the following assumptions will be made, unless instructed to the
        contrary:
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          The unexpired term of the lease is assumed to be 85 years, and no
          action is being taken by any eligible party with a view to acquiring
          the freehold or extending the lease term. RICS Valuation – Global

        </li>
        <li>
          There are no exceptionally onerous covenants upon the leaseholder.
        </li>
        <li>
          The lease cannot be determined, except on the grounds of a serious
          breach of covenant in the existing lease agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are separate freeholders, head and/or other subhead
          leaseholders, the terms and conditions of all the leases are in the
          same form and contain the same terms and conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The lease terms are mutually enforceable against all parties
          concerned.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are no breaches of covenant or disputes between the various
          interests concerned.
        </li>
        <li>
          The leases of all the properties in the building/development are
          materially the same.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ground rent stated, or assumed, is not subject to unreasonable
          review and is payable throughout the unexpired lease term.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the case of blocks of flats or maisonettes of over six dwellings,
          the freeholder manages the property directly, or there is an
          appropriate management structure in place.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a duty holder, as defined in the Control of Asbestos
          Regulations 2012, and there are in place an asbestos register and an
          effective management plan, which does not require any immediate
          expenditure, pose a significant risk to health, or breach Health and
          Safety Executive (HSE) requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where<strong> The Subject Property</strong> forms part of a mixed
          residential or commercially used block or development, there will be
          no significant changes in the existing pattern of use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where<strong> The Subject Property</strong> forms part of a
          development containing separate blocks of dwellings, the lease terms
          of the property apply only to the block. There will be no requirement
          to contribute towards costs relating to other parts of the
          development, other than in respect of common roads, paths, communal
          grounds and services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where<strong> The Subject Property</strong> forms part of a larger
          development whose ownership has since been divided, all necessary
          rights and reservations have been reserved.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are no unusual restrictions on assignment or subletting of the
          property for residential purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are no outstanding claims or litigation concerning the lease of
          the subject property or any others within the same development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where<strong> The Subject Property</strong> benefits from additional
          facilities within the development, the lease makes adequate provisions
          for the occupier to continue to enjoy them without exceptional
          restriction, for the facilities to be maintained adequately and for
          there being no charges over and above the service charge for such use
          and maintenance.

        For the avoidance of doubt, the<strong> Surveyor</strong> will not be
        under a duty to purchase data from third parties or to read the lease
        documentation. If further information is provided to the
        <strong> Surveyor</strong> after the valuation has been completed and
        submitted, the
        <strong> Surveyor</strong> may reconsider the valuation and, if
        necessary, issue an amended report. But again, for the avoidance of
        doubt, the
        <strong> Surveyor</strong> will not be under any obligation to read the
        lease document and would only be expected to base a revised valuation on
        further information provided to the
        <strong> Surveyor</strong> by your legal representatives.
