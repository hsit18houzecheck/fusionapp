            <li>
              <strong>The Client</strong> wishes the Company to arrange for a
              Surveyor to provide an opinion of the value of the Freehold or
              Leasehold or Commonhold interest in the Property as specified by
              the Client.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Surveyor</strong> shall provide to the Client a report
              based upon an inspection of the property by a named individual who
              shall be: 1. a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered
              Surveyors (RICS) holding one of the membership grades: AssocRICS,
              MRICS, or FRICS; and 2. a member of the RICS Valuer Registration
              Scheme (VRS), setting out the Valuer’s opinion of the relevant
              interest in the property. The Valuation and Report will be
              prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation Global Standards
              2022, effective 31st January 2022, and the RICS Valuation Global

            <li>
              <strong>Confidentiality</strong>: The Surveyor&apos;s valuation is
              provided to the named addressee/s alone and solely for the purpose
              of the instruction to which it relates. The valuation may not,
              without the Surveyor’s written consent, be used or relied upon by
              any other or third party, even if that third party pays all or
              part of the fees, or is permitted to see a copy of the Valuation
              Report. If the Surveyor provides written consent to a third party
              relying on the valuation, any such third party is deemed to have
              accepted the terms of our engagement and the Surveyor&apos;s
              engagement and an additional fee may be payable. Neither the whole
              nor any part of the report or any reference to it may be included
              in any published document, circular or statement nor published in
              any way without the Surveyor’s written approval of the form and
              context in which it may appear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Surveyor</strong> shall have no known interest in the
              Property or any other conflict that will prevent the Valuation
              Service from being undertaken in an independent, objective, and
              unbiased way.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Value</strong> reported unless otherwise specifically
              agreed in writing, shall be in accordance with one or more of the
              following Valuation bases: Market Value (MV) or Market Rent (MR)
              detailed at the end of these conditions. (See “Definitions”.) The
              value shall be provided in pounds sterling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Valuation Methodology</strong> shall be the Comparable
              Basis of Methodology unless at the sole discretion of the Valuer
              and subject to the interest, bearing income, an Investment
              Methodology may be adopted which will be stated in the Valuation
              Report.

              <strong>The Reinstatement Cost figure</strong> (If requested in
              the client instruction) for the permanent buildings is provided
              for insurance purposes and is not directly related to the market
              value of the property. The reinstatement cost will be calculated
              by reference to the indices and guidance published by the Building
              Costs Information Service (BCIS). The figure stated will only
              include Value Added Tax on professional fees (not on building
              costs) and will not take into account other potential or
              consequential losses such as costs of demolition, site clearance,
              provision of services, alternative accommodation, personal items
              or any other contents or contingent costs.

              <strong>Flats – Building Insurance</strong> will be for the

              company includes the flat in a block buildings insurance policy.

            <li>
              <strong>The Surveyor</strong> will make reasonable assumptions
              which will be specified in the Valuation Report. However, if these
              assumptions are found to be incorrect please advise us immediately
              as the valuation may require to be amended to take account of any
              newly disclosed, amended or discovered facts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Surveyor</strong> shall, unless otherwise expressly
              agreed, rely upon information from the Client or the Client’s
              legal or other professional advisers. It is the responsibility of
              the Client to ensure this information is accurate and to promptly
              advise the Valuer if it is not.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Client</strong> has requested a report on the value of
              the Property only. The Report is not a more thorough RICS Level 2
              Report, Level 3 Report or other detailed survey report. The
              Surveyor will draw attention to the general condition of the
              property and any visible major defects but only where these may
              have an eﬀect upon the Valuation.

            <li>
              <strong>External Cladding Panels and Fire Safety –</strong>{" "}
              Composite external panels which incorporate insulating material
              between inner and outer external wall faces such as aluminium
              composite material (ACM) panels have been extensively used in
              recent years as external cladding. Some panel cladding systems
              incorporate combustible insulation materials. The type of
              insulation and any fire checking of the panel system cannot be
              identified from a visual inspection. Where the existence of such
              panels has been reported, the type of insulation and installation
              <strong>
                {" "}
                is outside the scope of The Survey Report and the Valuation and
                Valuation Report
              </strong>
              . Other elements of the<strong> Property</strong> and building
              will also have a bearing on overall fire safety, including, fire
              doors, fire stops in wall cavities, escape routes, alarms and fire
              suppression systems. Such matters
              <strong>
                {" "}
                are outside the scope of the Valuation and/Valuation Report
              </strong>
              . For buildings of more than two storeys it is essential that the
              Fire Safety Certificate, (EWS1) is supplied. Where the nature of
              the cladding is considered to be suspect, the
              <strong> Surveyor</strong> will report a Zero Value until the form
              EWS1 in Compliance is supplied. For buildings of two storey height
              or less the Surveyor will make the assumption that the cladding
              system is satisfactory. It is the responsibility of
              <strong> The Client</strong> to have any materials tested and if
              found to be not in compliance, the Valuation may then require to
              be adjusted.
              <strong> The Client</strong> should make all necessary enquiries
              prior to any legal or financial commitment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asbestos</strong> and other hazardous materials: The
              construction of buildings, fixtures, fittings and plant or
              equipment may contain hazardous materials. Such materials are
              impossible to detect without specific tests and are beyond the
              scope of the Valuation Report. No guarantee is given that such
              materials are not incorporated in any part of the property or
              fixtures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Inspection</strong> will take into account gardens,
              grounds and permanent outbuildings, but will not include
              constructions or equipment with a specific or leisure purpose
              including sauna, swimming pools or tennis courts and associated
              services and changing rooms. The Inspection will include the
              immediate gardens that belong to the property, but the Inspection
              specifically excludes any additional land such as pasture or
              amenity land.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Measurement –</strong> The Surveyor may measure the
              property during the inspection or take measurements or areas from
              plans provided by the client or obtain such details from
              specialised database information available to the Surveyor or from
              publicly available information at the sole discretion of the
              Surveyor. Outbuildings will not be measured on site unless they
              are considered by the Surveyor to contribute significantly to the
              reported capital value or reinstatement cost (if reported).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Following Additional Assumptions</strong> will be made

              <br />
              <ol type="i">
                <li>
                  the ground is not affected by the existence of noxious or
                  toxic substances or gases and has not been used for landfill
                  or mineral extraction or other forms of contamination and does
                  not contain gypsum deposits;
                </li>
                <li>
                  no high alumina cement concrete or calcium chloride additive
                  or other potentially deleterious material including “Mundic
                  material” was used in the construction of the property or has
                  since been incorporated;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the Property is not susceptible to radon gas pollution,
                  invasive or protected species, flood risk, high voltage
                  equipment, cables or coastal erosion unless specified in the

                </li>
                <li>
                  the Property is not subject to any unusual or especially
                  onerous restrictions, encumbrances or outgoings, easements or
                  way leaves or rights of way over the property and that good
                  title can be shown;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the Property and its value are unaffected by any matters which
                  would be revealed by local or environmental searches, and
                  replies to the usual enquiries, or by any statutory notice,
                  and that neither the property, nor its condition, nor its use,
                  nor its intended use, is or will be unlawful;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the inspection of those parts which have not been included in
                  the Inspection in accordance with these Terms and Conditions
                  would neither reveal material defects nor cause the Valuer to
                  alter the valuation materially;
                </li>
                <li>
                  it is assumed that unless otherwise stated, roads, sewers and
                  services outside the curtilage of the property are the
                  responsibility of the Local Authority or other statutory body.
                  It is further assumed, unless otherwise stated, that all
                  services including drainage are connected and access and roads
                  are unfettered and in the case of the public highway
                  maintained at the expense of the Local and Highways
                  Authorities;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the Valuation is based on the assumption that the Property is
                  being valued with vacant possession and, unless otherwise
                  stated, for owner occupation; if the property is tenanted the
                  client is under a duty to inform the valuer;
                </li>
                <li>
                  that further investigation into Planning Permission, Building
                  Regulation, Permitted Development Rights, extensions and
                  alterations, hazardous materials, onerous restrictions or the
                  like will not reveal anything sufficiently adverse as to
                  materially affect the Valuation;
                </li>
                <li>
                  in the case of Leasehold Tenure the Valuer will assume that
                  there remains a minimum of 85 years on the lease and the
                  Ground Rent and any Service Charges are reasonable unless
                  otherwise detailed in the report.
                </li>
                <li>
                  there are no archaeological remains, Scheduled Ancient
                  Monument or liability to Chancel Repair and the property is
                  not at risk of flooding or likely to suffer damage from
                  unstable ground conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  any other assumptions will be clearly stated in the report;
                  however, the Valuer shall be under no duty to verify these
                  assumptions and the Client should ensure the assumptions are
                  correct. If any of these assumptions are incorrect then these
                  should be discussed with the Valuer before any financial or
                  legal commitment is made as the Valuer&apos;s opinion of value
                  may change.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Valuer has not been provided, or cannot obtain, an
                  up-to-date EPC rating for this property, for the purposes of
                  the Energy Act 2011, its valuation will be based on the
                  assumption that the subject property will meet the minimum
                  requirements laid down by legislation and that there will be
                  no adverse impact on value, rental ability and marketability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the case of a newly constructed property, it has been built
                  under a recognised builder’s warranty or insurance scheme, or
                  has been supervised by a professional consultant capable of
                  fully completing the UK Finance Professional Consultant
                  Certificate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are no ongoing insurance claims or neighbour disputes
                  and the property is insurable under normal terms.

              Where the dwelling is leasehold, data including unexpired lease
              term, ground rent and any further relevant information should be
              considered and reflected in the valuation based upon data that can
              be sourced on the day of inspection from either the client, vendor
              or selling agent as applicable following reasonable investigation.
              However, the surveyor clearly cannot give any absolute assurance
              that, if verbally provided, such data is reliable – verification
              will be a matter for your legal representatives as appropriate.
