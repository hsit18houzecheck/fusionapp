        HOUZECHECK POLICY: COMPLAINT HANDLING PROCEDURE
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify">
        <br />
        <br />
        Houzecheck Limited are regulated by the Royal Institution of Chartered
        Surveyors (RICS). We have a formal Complaint Handling Procedure (CHP)
        which meets the regulatory requirements of RICS.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our Complaint Handling Procedure has two sections: (1)
        <strong> Customer Service Complaints</strong> and (2)
        <strong> Surveyor Report Complaints</strong>. Both of these are dealt
        with in slightly different ways and offer you different stages to assist
        with the resolution of your complaint.
        <br />
        <br />
        With all stages, we will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within
        seven (7) days and investigate your complaint as quickly as possible. If
        we are not able to give you a full response, we will give you an update
        within 28 days. We will always take all complaints seriously and deal
        with them in a professional manner.
        <br />

        <br />
        The Surveyors that we work with are not employees of Houzecheck Limited,
        they are working with us as self-employed consultants under their own
        company name. Houzecheck Limited facilitates the arrangements between
        the customer and the Surveyor in administrating the setting up of the
        appointment, ensuring a smooth process through to delivery of the
        report, and dealing with any customer service queries.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have a Surveyor Report Complaint that cannot be dealt with as a
        simple customer service query, which relates to the content of your
        survey report, there are three stages to assist with the resolution of
        your complaint:
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Surveyor Report Complaints - Stage One</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We will raise your complaint with the Surveyor who completed your survey
        inspection and ask them to look into your complaint and provide a
        response. We return to you with their full response.
        <br />

        If your complaint has not been resolved via Stage One, please outline
        this to us in writing and we will pass your complaint to the Surveyor to
        respond to you directly. We will also aim to send you the Surveyor’s own
